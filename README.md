## üöÄ About Me
I am currently an undergraduate student majoring in Bioengineering at Marine College, Shandong University. Previously, I studied chemical engineering at Dalian University of Technology from 2019 to 2021.

I have participated in data science research as a research assistant at the Institute of International Studies, Shandong University, under the guidance of Dr. Jamal Khan and Prof. Yuan Li.

I was a member of the Climate Change Economics and Low Carbon Transition team from 2024.05-2024.08 under the supervision of Prof. Zhifu Mi and Dr. Haoran Zhang at University College London where I contributed to the development of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) database. Now I am a Research Intern in HKGAI, The Hongkong University of Science and Technology, deploying the HKGAI large model for the Hong Kong government, participating in data processing work for the research group, and conducting research in the fields of large language models (LLMs).

I am a member of International Input-Output Association (IIOA), the Chinese Society of Optimization, Overall Planning, and Economical Mathematics, and the Beijing Society of Image and Graphics. You can find my academic profile on ORCID.

‚Ä¢ This study highlights the significant impact of the Chinese financial sector on downstream growth, its vital intermediary role, and the internalization that followed the global financial crisis. It underscores the importance of integrated policies for managing evolving systemic risks in light of shifting intersectoral dynamics.

[7] Crespo, R., & Rodr√≠guez-Pose, A. (2024). *Innovation and Regional Growth in Europe* ([Ren Jianhui], Ed.). Beijing: Economic Management Press.

‚Ä¢ This book explores the complex relationship between innovation and regional growth, applying the social filter theory. It examines how collaborations among universities, research institutions, industries, and government entities drive regional innovation. Special focus is given to Europe's mechanisms for external innovation absorption and China's distinctive innovation dynamics, including the Belt and Road Initiative and dual circulation development strategy. I contributed as the translator for Chapter 3: Geographical Accessibility and Human Capital Accumulation.
